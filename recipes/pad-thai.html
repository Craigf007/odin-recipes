                <li>2 cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
                <li>1 carrot, thinly sliced into matchsticks</li>
                <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>

                <li>Lime wedges</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together all the stuff for the sauce in a medium glass.</li>
                <li>Cook your noodles according to the package directions. Rinse with cold water. Chop up the broccoli into pieces no bigger than a quarter and get all the rest of your veggies and herbs on lock. Get ready to stir-fry.</li>
                <li>Heat oil over medium heat in a big skillet or wok. 
                    When the pan is hot, add the shallots and stir-fry until they start to char around the edges, about 2 minutes. 
                    Add the broccoli and keep that up for another 2 minutes until the broccoli is a bit charred but isn't limp. 
                    Now add the garlic and fry it up for another 30 seconds. 
                    Gently add the noodles and 1/3 cup of the sauce and toss all around to make sure everything is covered. 
                    Keep stirring and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute to make sure the sauce is nice and absorbed. 
                    Keep adding more tablespoons of sauce until it is exactly how you like it. 
                    Turn off the heat and fold in the green onions and cilantro.</li>
                <li>Serve this mound of deliciousness right away piled high on a plate next to the cabbages, carrots, bean sprouts, and topped with peanuts.
                    Have some lime wedges shoved in there and squeeze all over it before you dig in.
                </li>
            </ol>
